# Block Buster - The Game
General notes

## Screen Overview
- Screen size: 256x224.
- Score and life count on top of the screen.
- 8x8 bricks grid.
- Lava on the bottom.
- Border on the sides and on top of the bricks.
- Bar 1.5 times the size of a brick.

## Brick Handling
Each line of the grid will be represented by one byte, where each bit shows
whether a brick is still there (1) or not (0).

## Ball trajectory
Change trajectory of the ball slightly so the path is not the same every time.
